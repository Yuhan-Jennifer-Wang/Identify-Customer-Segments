# Identify-Customer-Segments
Using RStudio to conduct PCA and clustering in population dataset and customer dataset to identify the target customers

## Introduction
This project is to help a mail-order sales company to improve sales.
The target audience of this campaign would also be the target group of our company, because they are assumed to have the highest expected return.
Thus, the question is who are the target groups of our company? 
This project aims to help identify this group of people using the segments of the population. 
Research questions includes:
1. What are the different segmentations in the population?
2. What are the segmentation composition in the customer base?
3. Who are the overrepresented cohort in our company?
The data comes from Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.
